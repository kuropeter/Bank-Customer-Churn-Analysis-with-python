# Churn Analysis Project - Readme

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to analyze customer churn for a bank using Python. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon of customers leaving a company's services or products. By understanding the factors that contribute to churn, the bank can take proactive measures to retain customers and reduce the overall churn rate. The dataset contains several columns including `CreditScore`, `Geography`, `Gender`, `Age`, `Tenure`, `Balance`, `NumOfProducts`, `HasCreditCard`, `IsActiveMember`, `EstimatedSalary`, and `Exited`.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files and directories:

1. **data**: This directory contains the dataset used for analysis. It should include the necessary input files in a suitable format.

2. **notebooks**: This directory contains the Jupyter Notebooks used for data analysis and model building. The notebooks are organized as follows:
   - `01_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb`: This notebook focuses on data exploration and visualization. It provides insights into the dataset, identifies patterns, and helps in understanding the data.

   - `02_Modeling.ipynb`: This notebook focuses on building predictive models using various algorithms. It includes implementing logistic regression, naive Bayes, decision tree, random forest, SVM, and XGBoost. The model evaluation metrics are calculated to compare the performance of each model.

3. **output**: This directory contains the output files generated during the analysis. It includes any visualizations, summaries, or results obtained from the EDA and modeling process.

4. **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and instructions on how to use the code.

## Project Execution

To reproduce the results of this project, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.

2. Set up the required Python environment by installing the necessary libraries and dependencies. It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

3. Ensure that the dataset is present in the `data` directory and is correctly formatted.

4. Open the Jupyter Notebooks in the `notebooks` directory using Jupyter Notebook or any other compatible environment.

5. Run `01_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb` to perform EDA on the dataset. This notebook will generate visualizations and insights into the data.

6. Run `02_Modeling.ipynb` to build predictive models using logistic regression, naive Bayes, decision tree, random forest, SVM, and XGBoost. This notebook will evaluate the models based on various metrics and identify the model with the highest accuracy.

7. Examine the output files in the `output` directory to review the results and visualizations generated during the analysis.

## Decisions and Recommendations

Based on the churn analysis project, several decisions and recommendations can be made for the bank:

1. **Customer Retention Strategies**: Identify the key factors contributing to customer churn, such as low credit scores, high balances, or inactive membership. Develop targeted strategies to address these issues and enhance customer retention efforts.

2. **Product Optimization**: Analyze the `NumOfProducts` column to understand how the number of products a customer uses affects churn. Determine if customers with a higher number of products are more likely to churn or if there is an optimal range. Optimize product offerings and incentives to retain customers within that range.

3. **Geographical Analysis**: Investigate the `Geography` column to identify any regional variations in churn rates. Determine if there are specific regions with higher churn rates and examine the reasons behind it. Tailor marketing and customer service efforts to address regional variations and reduce churn.

4. **Gender Analysis**: Explore the impact of `Gender` on churn. Identify if there

 are any gender-related patterns contributing to churn and design gender-specific retention strategies accordingly.

5. **Tenure and Age**: Analyze the relationship between `Tenure`, `Age`, and churn rates. Determine if there is an optimal tenure or age range that correlates with lower churn. Develop strategies to retain customers within that range or offer tailored benefits to long-standing customers.

6. **Credit Card Usage**: Investigate the impact of `HasCreditCard` on churn rates. Identify if customers with or without credit cards exhibit different churn behaviors. Utilize this insight to optimize credit card offerings or incentivize card usage to reduce churn.

7. **Model Selection**: Select the model with the highest accuracy from the evaluated algorithms (logistic regression, naive Bayes, decision tree, random forest, SVM, and XGBoost). This chosen model can be deployed to predict churn for new customers and guide retention strategies effectively.

By leveraging the insights gained from this churn analysis project, the bank can take proactive measures to reduce customer churn, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance overall business performance.
